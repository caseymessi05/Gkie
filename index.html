                    <blockquote>
                        Photography is a way of feeling, of touching, of loving. What you have caught on film is captured forever ... It remembers little things, long after you have forgotten everything.
                        Storytelling is one of my passion in this world and I love to share it to the world through filmmaking.
                        I am a reserved extrovert whose passion is telling stories through film and photos. Currently working as a film and wedding video editor in Bacolod City. 
                        When not doing any creative work I read manga, watch movies or go on a bike ride.
